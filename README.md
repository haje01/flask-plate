flask-plate
===========

Poor boilerplate for using flask &amp; bootstrap

### Get Started
1. <pre>git clone git://github.com/haje01/flask-plate</pre>

2. find 'myapp's in the following files and change it into your own app's name
<pre>
    ./myapp.uwsgi.xml
    ./application.py
    ./myapp/config.py
    ./myapp (folder name)
</pre>

3. remove .git folder and init new git repository.
4. edit as your own!
</pre>
