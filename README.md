===========

Poor boilerplate for using flask, bootstrap &amp; redis.

### Get Started

1. Clone from Github
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/haje01/flask-plate.git</pre>

1. Rename 'flask-plate' folder as your project name, and cd into it.

1. Install required python modules.
    <pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>

1. Find 'myapp's in the following files and change it into your own app's name
    <pre>
        ./admin
        ./application.py
        ./myapp/config.py
        ./myapp/util.py
        ./myapp.uwsgi.xml
        ./myapp  (folder name)
    </pre>

1. Run application, then test 'localhost:8000' with you browser.
    <pre>python application.py</pre>
